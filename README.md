# Database Forge

A Python project using SQLAlchemy ORM with SQLite3 to demonstrate basic database operations: table creation, data population, and data retrieval/display.

## Features
- Uses SQLAlchemy ORM to define and manage SQLite database tables
- Two tables: Category and Product (with relationships)
- Populates tables with sample data
- Retrieves and displays data with summary statistics

## Requirements
- Python 3.7+
- [SQLAlchemy](https://www.sqlalchemy.org/)

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/AMANSINGH1674/Hackweek--Database-Forge.git
   cd Hackweek--Database-Forge
   ```
2. **Install dependencies:**
   ```bash
   pip install sqlalchemy
   ```

## Usage
1. **Run the script:**
   ```bash
   python database_forge.py
   ```
   (Or `python main.py` if you rename the script.)

2. **Output:**
   - The script will create `database_forge.db` (SQLite database) in the project directory.
   - It will print product and category data, as well as summary statistics, to the console.
